  > ~~tip : rofi works best on version 1.6.1. if you are using version 1.7.0, it only showing the outline of the selected apps.      
  > yes, this is the bug but since i don't know how to configure rofi properly, i can't really fix that rn. ~~         
  
  > Update : rofi compatibillity with 1.7.0 is now added. now you can use rofi 1.7.0      
  > for 1.6.1, there is a fallback folder for rofi 1.6.1



  > You don't need to install both i3 and bspwm. you are only required to install one of them

# Issues
> I opened Thunar but it appears to be black theme        

Delete the gtk-dark.css on the theme folder, on gtk3.0


# Notes
* If you are installing this on systemd , don't forget to change the loginctl
 command to systemctl on clearine.conf and polybar config
* Polybar is disabled by default. to enable it run "launchbar" if you are on zsh shell. or uncomment the launch.sh on i3/config. this only affect i3 users. user that using bspwm as their default didn't need to configure this as the polybar is executed during startup
